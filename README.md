# VN_Fuel (Beta)

VN_Fuel provides a fuel system and hud system for vehicles. It allows you to select 87, 89, or 91. 87 and 91 adds a performance boost to vehicles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Fuel Usage**: Vehicles consume fuel based on RPM and vehicle class, requiring players to refuel.
- **Fuel Types**: Offers three types of fuel, each with a unique cost and performance boost. ** WORK IN PROGRESS. DYNAMIC PRICES ARE PLANNED FOR EACH OF THE THREE FUELS. **
- **Performance Boost**: Vehicles receive a performance boost upon refueling, depending on the type of fuel used. ** WORK IN PROGRESS. REQUIRES TESTING. **
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar is displayed to players while refueling, enhancing the user experience.

## Installation

Ensure that ND_Core, ox_target, and ox_lib are all started before this script in your server.cfg

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to your `resources` directory in your FiveM server.
3. Add `ensure VN_Fuel` to your server's `server.cfg` file.
4. Start your server or restart the resource if the server is already running.

## Usage

Players must drive to the nearest fuel pump where they can refuel their vehicle. The script checks if the player has enough money before refueling starts. If not, it cancels the process. Players can press "E" to stop refueling at any time.

The script is currently in beta. Functionality such as fuel consumption, performance boosts, and user interaction are subject to change based on feedback and further development.
