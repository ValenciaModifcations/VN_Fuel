# VN_Fuel
This is a modified LegacyFuel script for NDCore, fully configured and works as is.

### Note
The Jerrycan function has not been tested and may not work- but the vehicle refueling section does work.

### Installation
1) Download the latest version in the "code" tab on GitHub.
2) Drag & drop the folder into your `resources` server folder.
3) Configure the config file to your liking.
4) Add `start VN_Fuel` to your server config.
